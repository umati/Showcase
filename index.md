## Demonstrator story umati showcase

### The umati vision

Connectivity with umati - universal machine technology interface - is simple, secure and future-oriented. Any machine with an umati interface can be easily connected with applications. No matter whether you are end user, system integrator or machine builder: with the umati interface you will be able to easily connect to machines of all manufacturers and controls. umati is an initiative by the  The umati community is an association of companies from the mechanical and plant engineering industry that jointly and comprehensively bring a common interface concept based on OPC UA to the market for the entire mechanical and plant engineering sector. Currently it is sponsored and hosted by the German Machine Tool Builders' Association [(VDW)](https://vdw.de) and the German Engineering Federation [(VDMA)](https://vdma.org).

## umati showcase

This showcase demonstrates how **umati partners** connect components, machines and applications via a connectivity showcase. This showcase  targets decision-makers in the machinery industry with a uniform marketing strategy and demonstrations showing the depth of the umati interface: from umati component suppliers over umati machine builders to umati partner applications that cumulate the data in dashboards, ERP, MES and cloud systems.

Trade fair guests will get information about umati at any of the participants&#39; booths and will be offered a hands-on experience via a white-label dashboard. The dashboard offers data of each individual machine connected through umati. The dashboard is easily accessible through any web browser with individual QR codes offering weblinks at each machine. It further offers responsive design for mobile end users.

Marketing for umati will be visible on all participants&#39; booths. All participants&#39; booths will have umati-informed persons on site. Central umati marketing events will offer general information, depict specific use cases, offer Q&amp;A sessions and deliver experience reports over the duration of the trade fair. Marketing statements for umati showcase are coordinated centrally and distributed to all showcase participants. Please refer to chapter 3 for further details.

Ramp-up for all umati showcase demonstrations will be available in advance of the trade fair with an offered exemplary umati showcase test server.

if the partner is an end user of machinery or software)
- The “partner” is obliged to ensure the visibility of umati in his communication, which includes
placing a reference to umati in his internet presence and to link to [http://umati.org](http://www.umati.org)
- The “partner” should become actively involved in the development of related OPC UA standards (providing feedback on documents circulated to the partners; participation in tests, plug fests, hackathons and the like).
- The “partner” shall support communication of umati, e.g. by providing statements or visuals, and permits the use of the “partner’s” logo for all public relations activities relating to umati.

Obligations of participants (A) showing applications

Participants (A) need to be aware, show sensitivity, and communicate that the umati showcase demonstration is demonstration only, i.e., data flowing in which can be used for analysis is not real production data and cannot be used to deduct any considerations regarding the performance of any connected equipment.

Please refer to the MoU for further details. In case of doubt/discrepancies to the preceding list the regulations as denoted in the MoU shall apply.

### Clarifications

**What&#39;s the MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) for?**

The umati brand MoU has the purpose to agree on (simple) terms and conditions for the use of your company name and logo by us (umati) and our umati logo by your company.

**When do we have to sign the MoU?**

If you would like us to show your logo and link your company on the umati website and include you in marketing of the umati initiative, or if you would like to advertise your contribution to umati to your customers, especially by making use of the umati logo. Especially, if you want to participate in the fair demonstration and virtual demonstrations. If you have registered as a umati partner already, there is no need to sign the MoU again

We hope the simple and straightforward terms of cooperation serve to increase public visibility of the umati brand by having many participants making use of the umati logo.

### Marketing package for umati showcase participants

All participants received a marketing package which will be updated as the trade fairs approach. It currently contains the following items and can be found at: [https://vdw.de/umati-partner](https://vdw.de/umati-partner):

- **umati partner logo:** The umati Partner logo should be used in your marketing and press materials online as well as offline.

- **umati sticker for the connected machines:** [TODO: is currently prepared – not yet available] Each machine should be outfitted with a umati sticker. If you are connecting a machine that is not located on the fair ground, please find a suitable place for this sticker on your booth to enable visitors to access the dashboard side of your machine with this code. A picture of the sticker is shown below (diameter 200mm).

- **press release from VDW** : informs about the showcase and the registered parties. Please use it also for your own communication as a template. Further press releases are going to follow.
- **umati showcase folder** : [TODO:is currently prepared – not yet available] we will prepare a umati folder like the EMO version, but with more content and listing every partner and the booth information.
- **umati dashboard:** We provide a umati dashboard via a weblink to visualize all machines connected to the showcase. You are free to use this dashboard at your own booth. The dashboard access is described in chapter 4.
- **umati representative preparation/briefing:** We provide extensive documentation for your umati representatives (called umati Ambassadors), such that your employees can answer the most common questions concerning umati. For other booth personnel we provide a shortened version of this document.

### Necessary interaction by the participants are

- If you publish information or are mentioning umati partnership in other places, please **keep us informed by either sending a copy or a URL** for online material.

- For the fair with a central **umati booth**, there will be a logo wall with all umati partners. Please **provide a logo to us**.
- For picturing your machine on the umati dashboard, please **send us a picture of the specific machine** to [info@umati.org](mailto:info@umati.org) (Image will be compressed to 1100x800 if it&#39;s larger) together with the Namespace URI of the machine in the datahub. If you do not provide a picture, we will instead display a dummy machine icon.

## Connection scheme and testing

### Datahub connection

For this showcase we will have a data hub provided off premise. This will act as an OPC UA aggregation server. The machine server (M) will connect via an OpenVPN tunnel to an VPN endpoint (one per partner). An OPC UA client will connect to the [OPC UA Server](SERVER.html)(s) of that partner through the VPN tunnel. The application providers (A) will connect to an [OPC UA Server](SERVER.html).

To connect to this data hub (M) need an [OPC UA Server](SERVER.html) and OpenVPN client to access one dedicated endpoint per partner. (A) will connect via OPC UA directly to the datahub.

### umati showcase test server

A test server is provided for basic testing and is supplied by VDW.

The test server provides the complete data model and changes its values. There is no real machine tool simulation behind the [OPC UA Server](SERVER.html). The values do not necessarily have a logical connection to each other. For example, the channel can be deactivated while the job is still being processed. The server is available at `opc.tcp://opcua.umati.app:4840` ; authentication is not required.
